### Vision
To make the adoption of Ruby on Rails easier for use in projects.

### Philosophy
Keep with the _**[Boring Rails](https://boringrails.com/)**_ practice and way of doing things.

With some added nuances for developer happiness.

And Reactiveness...

## What's in the box


- **SimpleTails** a [TailwindCSS prose](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) implementation heavily inspired by [SimpleCSS](https://simplecss.org/).

- [ViteRuby](https://vite-ruby.netlify.app/) for lightning fast server starts, instant page update in development thanks to HMR nd much more

- [Anyway Config](https://github.com/palkan/anyway_config) to keep your Ruby configuration sane

- [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org/) - A framework for creating reusable, testable & encapsulated view components, built to integrate seamlessly with Ruby on Rails.

- [LookBook](https://github.com/ViewComponent/lookbook) - A tool to help browse, develop, test & document ViewComponents in Ruby on Rails apps

- [Tailwind Config Viewer](https://github.com/rogden/tailwind-config-viewer) - A local UI tool for visualizing your Tailwind CSS configuration file.

- [Avo](https://avohq.io/) - Avo uses familiar configuration to build up the features you need from most applications.
  The result is a full-featured customer-facing app that works out of the box, ready to be used to your end-users. 
  > **NB:** Avo will likely  be removed for an OSS oprion or self rolled solution 

- [overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit) is a tool to manage and configure [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).

## Using overcommit

[overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit) a fully configurable and extendable Git hook manager is included.
When enabled the hooks will run each time a git commit is made. If any of the checks fail the commit will be ignored and
the erros will be shown.

Enable overcommit

```bash
 overcommit --sign && overcommit --sign pre-commit
````

Run overcommit

```bash
 overcommit --run
````

You should see the following
![pre-commit hooks image](docs/images/overcommit-run.png)

The above pre commit hooks have been defined in [.overcommit.yml](.overcommit.yml)
